# Notes

### Java Basic:
#### Array:
  - Declaring array : int intArray[];    
  - Allocating memory to array : int Array = new int[20]; 

### We are using React.js for the frontend and ASP.NET for the backend.
#### React.js
  - Using react.js with TypeScript and JavaScript
  - Using Material UI's component, [MUI](https://mui.com/)
  - Using [constate](https://github.com/diegohaz/constate) for the state management
  
  - In React we need to use useMemo to stop rerendering every time. 
  - Even if we change a value in the react, it would rerender all the components.
  - When we change a value, React rerenders all the components eventhough those components are not using that value.
  - So, it is little bit difficult to stop rerendering each time.


### We are using Ember.js for the frontend and spring boot for the backend.
#### Ember.js
  - In Ember the page doesn't rerender like it does in React.
